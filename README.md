- According to the analysis after calculating annual return of each stocks in 2018, DQ is having negative return about -62.6% shrunk, we will recommend Steve to stop investing all of money from his paretns to DQ. By contrast,the stocks ENPH and RUN is having positive return which are almost reach to 100%, so we will recommend Steve to diversify the investment porfolio and put relatively more amount of fund into these two stocks.
   
## Summary

- The advantage of refactoring code is helping developer and end user to efficiently store, read and maintain the code and save the time for next modification. The disadvantage of it is about time consuming, as long as the increasing complexity of the code the time will be much more longer and will affect the total efficiency of the work

- The advantage of original code is explicitly showing the purpose of each line of code and provide step by step procedures, diadvantage is not having proper format.
